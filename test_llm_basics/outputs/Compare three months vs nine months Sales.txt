 Sales by Market: 

As mentioned before sales in the market semiconductors showed a positive trend and therefore influenced the development in the category semiconductors and coating. In contrast the demand in the coating market stayed quite challenging. Due to the COVID-19 situation the sales with customers from analytics, industry and R&D declined compared to previous year.For competitive reasons we decided to carry out our sales analysis by market on a more consolidated level from financial year 2020 on. The previous year’s figures have been adjusted accordingly. For the same reason, we refrain from disclosing sales by product.
