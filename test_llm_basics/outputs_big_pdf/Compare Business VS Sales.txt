The terms "business" and "sales" are often related but they refer to different aspects of a company's operations. 

Business, in a general sense, refers to the overall operations and activities that a company engages in to produce goods or services, generate revenue, and make a profit. It encompasses a wide range of activities including but not limited to product development, marketing, sales, customer service, finance, and human resources. Business activities are what a company does to run its operations and pursue its strategic goals.

Sales, on the other hand, is a specific aspect of a business that involves the transactions where goods or services are exchanged for money. It is a part of the business activity focused on the direct or indirect process of persuading a customer to purchase a product or service. Sales figures are a measure of the effectiveness of a company's sales strategies and activities, and they are an indicator of the market demand for what the company is offering.

In the context of an interim management report, a comparison between business and sales would involve looking at how the overall business strategies and operations are translating into actual sales performance. For instance, the report might explore how changes in business activities (such as increased R&D spending, changes in administrative expenses, or shifts in market strategies) are impacting sales figures across different segments and regions.

Based on the provided context, the sales in the first three quarters of 2020 totaled â‚¬ 453.9 million, which is a decrease compared to the same period in 2019. This indicates that while the business may be investing in areas like R&D and administrative expenses, these investments have not yet translated into increased sales. The sales figures, combined with the other financial metrics like operating profit and net income, provide a snapshot of how the business is performing within a given timeframe.
