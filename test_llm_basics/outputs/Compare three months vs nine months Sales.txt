To compare the three-month sales versus the nine-month sales, we will look at each segment as well as the total sales for both periods.

For the segment "Semiconductors + Coating":
- Three months ended September 30, 2020: 75,022 K€
- Nine months ended September 30, 2020: 233,500 K€

For the segment "Industry + Analytics + R & D":
- Three months ended September 30, 2020: 76,985 K€
- Nine months ended September 30, 2020: 220,361 K€

For the total sales:
- Three months ended September 30, 2020: 152,007 K€
- Nine months ended September 30, 2020: 453,861 K€

If we compare the sales for the three-month period against the nine-month period, we can observe that the nine-month figures are significantly higher. This is expected as the nine-month period encompasses three times the duration of the three-month period. However, to understand the growth or decline rate, we would typically compare the same periods across different years, but this information is not requested here.

It's important to note that the nine-month values are not simply a multiple of the three-month values because sales can fluctuate throughout the year due to various factors, including seasonal trends, market demands, and in 2020 particularly, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
