The sales decline compared to the previous year was primarily attributed to the impact of COVID-19, particularly in Europe, where the semiconductor business was unable to offset the negative effects of the pandemic. This led to a decrease in sales for Europe by 6.6%. The overall decline in sales was also reflected in the lower sales figures for some countries; France's contribution decreased from 9.5% to 6.6%, Germany's from 17.6% to 15.6%, and the category labeled as All Others from 4.3% to 3.3%. Despite the growth in the Asian region, particularly due to the development of semiconductor-customers, the negative impacts in other regions led to a total consolidated sales reduction to 453.9 million euros from the previous 467.3 million euros.
