To compare the three months versus nine months sales, we will look at the differences in sales for the same categories across the two different time periods provided in the table.

For the category "Semiconductors + Coating":
- In the three months ended September 30, 2020, sales were 75,022K€.
- In the nine months ended September 30, 2020, sales were 233,500K€.

For the category "Industry + Analytics + R & D":
- In the three months ended September 30, 2020, sales were 76,985K€.
- In the nine months ended September 30, 2020, sales were 220,361K€.

For the total sales across all categories:
- In the three months ended September 30, 2020, total sales were 152,007K€.
- In the nine months ended September 30, 2020, total sales were 453,861K€.

From this, we can observe that for both individual categories and the total sales, the nine-month period has significantly higher sales figures compared to the three-month period. This is expected as the nine-month period covers a longer time frame, resulting in more accumulated sales. Specifically, the nine-month sales figures are more than three times the three-month sales figures for both categories and the total, which would make sense if the sales remained relatively consistent month to month.
