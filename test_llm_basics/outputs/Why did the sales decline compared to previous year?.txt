 Interim Management Report: 

Sales in the first three quarters of 2020 totaled € 453.9 million. Following € 467.3 million in the first nine months of 2019, this represents a decrease by € 13.5 million, or 2.9 %, respectively. Based on a somewhat weaker overall demand situation sales in the third quarter of the current fiscal year totaled € 152.0 million and were thus slightly below the level of Q3/2019 (€ 156.2 million). The strongest sales development in the first three quarters 2020 was recorded in the market segment semiconductors, which was able to almost fully compensate the downtrend in the other segments. In total, the gross profit decreased by € 3.4 million, or 2.1 %, respectively, to € 158.0 million (2019: € 161.4 million). Particularly changes in product mix improved the gross margin slightly from 34.5% to 34.8 %. Due to the Group’s focus on further growth general and administrative expenses recorded an increase by € 2.5 million to € 43.5 compared to the first three quarters of 2019 (€ 40.9 million). The R & D expenses increased by € 4.3 million to € 25.5 million for the first three quarters of 2020 compared to € 21.2 million for the first three quarters of 2019. Selling and marketing expenses on the contrary only showed slight increases in the first nine months of 2020 compared to the previous year. The balance of other operating income and expenses declined by € 4.8 million to € 0.6 million compared to previous year. In total, an operating profit of € 35.7 million was generated in the first three quarters of the current fiscal year, down by € 13.2 million, or 27.5 %, compared to previous year’s value of € 48.9 million. As a consequence the EBIT margin, the ratio between operating profit and sales, decreased from 10.5 % in 2019 to 7.9 %. With virtually constant net financial expenses and a slightly increased tax rate, net income decreased from € 34.7 million to € 24.8 million. This led to earnings per share of € 2.51 (2019: € 3.52).
