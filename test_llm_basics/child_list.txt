Interim Management Report: 
The following graphic shows the still balanced split of sales by region.

Sales in the Semiconductors + Coating market saw an increase from €70,729K in the three months ended September 30, 2019, to €75,022K in the same period in 2020.

Additionally, the nine-month period ending September 30 showed growth from €218,047K in 2019 to €233,500K in 2020.

In contrast, the Industry + Analytics + R & D sector experienced a decrease in sales, with a reduction from €85,496K in the three months ended September 30, 2019, to €76,985K for the same period in 2020, and from €249,286K to €220,361K for the nine-month period.

The total combined sales across the markets decreased slightly from €156,225K to €152,007K for the three-month period and from €467,333K to €453,861K for the nine-month period year-over-year.

How do the revenues from the Semiconductors + Coating segment in the three months ended September 30, 2020, compare to the same period in 2019?

What is the total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, and how does it differ from the total revenue for the same period in 2019?

By how much did the revenue from the Industry + Analytics + R & D segment decrease in the three months ended September 30, 2020, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2019?

What was the revenue growth or decline for the Semiconductors + Coating segment when comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2020, to the same period in 2019?

Can we infer if the total combined revenue from both segments saw growth or decline in the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to each respective period in 2019?

Sales by Market: 
As mentioned before sales in the market semiconductors showed a positive trend and therefore influenced the development in the category semiconductors and coating.

Sales by Market: 
In contrast the demand in the coating market stayed quite challenging.

Sales by Market: 
Due to the COVID-19 situation the sales with customers from analytics, industry and R&D declined compared to previous year.

The semiconductor market has experienced a positive sales trend that has contributed to growth in the semiconductor and coating sector.

On the other hand, the coating market itself faced tougher demand conditions.

The pandemic caused by COVID-19 led to reduced sales with clients in the analytics, industry, and research and development sectors when compared to the prior year.

What trend did sales in the market for semiconductors show?

How did the positive trend in semiconductor sales influence development in certain categories?

Which categories were influenced by semiconductor sales trends?

What contrast is presented in the demand for the coating market?

How did the COVID-19 situation affect sales with customers from analytics, industry, and R&D?

Compared to which time frame did sales decline for customers from analytics, industry, and R&D due to COVID-19?

Sales by Market: 
For competitive reasons we decided to carry out our sales analysis by market on a more consolidated level from financial year 2020 on.

Sales by Market: 
The previous year’s figures have been adjusted accordingly.

Sales by Market: 
For the same reason, we refrain from disclosing sales by product.

The semiconductor market has experienced positive sales trends, which have had an impact on the development within the semiconductor and coating categories.

However, the coating market demand faced challenges.

The sales to analytics, industry, and R&D customers dropped due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

To maintain a competitive edge, the sales analysis by market has been more consolidated since the financial year 2020, with previous figures adjusted to match this new level of reporting.

Sales figures are not being broken down by product to preserve competitive confidentiality.

What trend did the semiconductor market show as mentioned in the text?

How did the positive trend in the semiconductor market affect its development?

What was the market demand like in the coating market?

Starting from which financial year did the company decide to conduct its sales analysis on a more consolidated level?

Why did the company decide to conduct sales analysis by market on a more consolidated level?

Have the previous year’s figures been adjusted following the change in sales analysis approach?

Does the company disclose sales by product?

If not, why?

The sales distribution by region is as follows: Europe contributed 35.9% (previously 37.2%), The Americas accounted for 26.5% (previously 26.9%), and Asia made up 37.6% (previously 35.9%) of total sales.

The total sales amount is 453.9 million euros, which was previously 467.3 million euros.

The sales are fairly evenly distributed between Europe and Asia, which together constitute a majority of the sales, while The Americas represent a smaller portion.

What percentage of the total sales is contributed by Europe currently and what was the previous percentage?

How much of the total sales does The Americas account for now, and what was their previous contribution percentage?

What is the current percentage of total sales made up by Asia and what was the percentage previously?

What is the total sales amount in million euros currently?

What was the total sales amount in million euros previously?

Are sales more evenly distributed between Europe and Asia or do other regions contribute significantly as well?

Which region represents the smaller portion of the sales?

Do Europe and Asia together constitute a majority of the sales?

By how much has Europe's percentage contribution to total sales decreased?

By how much has Asia's percentage contribution to total sales increased?
