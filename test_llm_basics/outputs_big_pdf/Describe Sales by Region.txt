The provided context does not include a detailed table or graphic for Sales by Region, so I cannot describe specific sales figures, trends, or distributions across regions. However, I can tell you that Sales by Region generally refers to the breakdown of a company's sales based on geographical areas. This can show which regions are performing well and which are underperforming, and it can inform strategic business decisions to improve sales in various markets.

Since the context mentions that the table includes all sales in a given region, regardless of which company in the Pfeiffer Vacuum Group generated these sales, it suggests that the data would be aggregated to show the total performance of the group in each region.

Unfortunately, without the actual sales data or a graphic representation, I'm unable to provide further details regarding Sales by Region for the Pfeiffer Vacuum Group. If you have the table or the graphic, I could help interpret that information.
